# BookS
Basic Book Website Scraper

This web scraper is written in Python and uses the BeautifulSoup library to parse HTML content from a website and extract specific information from it. 
The script uses two libraries- requests and BeautifulSoup from the bs4 library. Requests makes HTTP get requests to the website to fetch html content.
You can customise this script by replacing the url of the book website to scrape.
It then loops through the book listing and processes the information on the page.

The script at the moment is designed to scrape a single page. If the site has multiple pages of book listings, modifications are necessary.
